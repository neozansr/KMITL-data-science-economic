At the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25%â€“5.50% for the seventh consecutive meeting. The Fed emphasized that it would not consider lowering rates until inflation is consistently moving toward its 2% target. Despite some easing in inflation over the past year, it remains elevated. The Fed continues to reduce its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. The economic outlook remains uncertain, with the Fed noting that recent economic activity has expanded at a solid pace, job gains remain strong, and the unemployment rate is low. However, inflationary pressures persist, and the Fed remains vigilant regarding inflation risks. Looking forward, the Fed expects to keep rates steady until there is greater confidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% goal. The Committee also projects that there might be one rate cut later this year and several more in 2025 if economic conditions permit.
